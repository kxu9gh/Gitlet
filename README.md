# Gitlet
    This is a project from UC Berkeley CS61BL summer 2019.
This is a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular version-control system git, but it is smaller and simpler, so we have named it gitlet.

The main functionalities are:
- Committing: Saving backups of directories of files. 
- Checking out: Restoring a backup version of one or more files or entire commits. 
- Log: Viewing the history of your backups. 
- Branches: Maintaining related sequences of commits.
- Merge: Merging changes made in one branch into another.
